 Student.com aims to provide quality accommodation to the masses on a global scale. By having more verified rooms than any other business in the space, Student.com allows students to choose with absolute peace of mind, wherever theyâ€™re coming from. 
 
 During my time at Student.com I produced localised UI for the several products, supporting over 20 languages including an adapted China site. I hired and lead a talented team of designers whilst managing multiple stakeholders and advocating UX principles across the business.
