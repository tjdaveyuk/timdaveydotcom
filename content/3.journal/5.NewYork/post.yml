  The Trans-Canada trip started oddly enough in New York. I had a list of things to do and see the size of my arm, thanks to friends and family that raved about the place. We stayed in Bedstuy, somewhere I was told was still a little rough around the edges, the prodominantly jewish neighbourhood reminded me a little of Hackney.

  We choose to walk most places. We averaged about 12 miles a day, walking through most of west Brooklyn, Williamsburg, Queens, Flushing and a chunk of Manhattan. Highlights included Katz' deli, eating sichzuan in Flushing, catching Poncho Sanchez at the Blue Note and spotting Malcolm Gladwell in Fort Greene park. 

  We left on the coach bound for Boston feeling exhausted, despite barely scratching the surface of what NY had to offer. Can't wait to return.
