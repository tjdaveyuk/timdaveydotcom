  This spring, a good pal and I took a long weekend off and headed to the Lake District to climb Scafell Pike. We warmed up with a couple of small fell climbs to find some hidden water falls and do some fishing. The following morning we drove to [Wasdale head](<https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Wasdale+Head,+Seascale,+Cumbria+CA20/@54.4681768,-3.255929,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487cc8b90ba9d8a1:0x5628c80d862314f9>), stocked up on energy bars and commenced the 3.5 hour climb. 

  Somehow, we made it to the 3,209 ft summit, catching great views of Mickledore, Broad Crag and Wast water on our way up. And walking through every kind of weather imaginable. 7 or so hours later, we retired to the pub for many a pint of the [local ale](<http://www.hawksheadbrewery.co.uk/>). Below are a few snaps from the weekend.
