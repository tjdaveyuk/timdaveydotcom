  I recently decided to leave my job, my friends and London, to travel. Half my family live in Canada and I'm ashamed to say I've only met most of them a handful of times. I'm hopping across the pond this summer to explore country and get back in touch with my roots. Gulp.

  Before setting off, I had a few weeks back in my home town of Locks Heath. When not planning the trip, I got to see some old pals, do some fishing and hang out with my father and his classic car club. Here's a few snaps from the past few weeks before I set off.
