  This May, my better half and I took a short trip to the Adriatic coast, to explore a little more of Croatia and it's surrounding areas. Flying from London to Dubrovnik, we took a sketchy 2 hour coach ride, across the Montenegro border, down to Kotor Bay. After a few days in Kotor, exploring neighbouring towns and eating lots of good seafood, we hopped back on the coach for Dubrovnik.

  From the Dubrovnik ferry port, we took one of two daily ferrys through the Adriatic islands to the western island of Mljet. Okuklje is a small village on the south east of the island. It's home to about 60 residents, yet still has a [modest count](<https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Okuklje--Croatia?sw_lat=42.5753623364574&sw_lng=17.416447670528214&ne_lat=42.86828404173821&ne_lng=17.72818473107509&zoom=11&search_by_map=true>) on AirBnb. Mljet is the only Dalmatian island that wasn't stripped of it's wood by the Venetians in 500 A.D, to build what is now Venice. As such it's very, very green and home to a staggering amount of wild life. A few snaps from the trip are below.
