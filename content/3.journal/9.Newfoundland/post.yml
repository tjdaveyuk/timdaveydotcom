  From Toronto we decided to double back and head to St John Newfoundland. I was told about my ancestors originating from the island and my great Uncle Sid still lived there. We were met at the airport by my great uncle and taken to his house to hear stories about my unknown family. From there we headed an hour south to Tors cove where we stayed for a week. 

  The island feels distinctly irish, not least for the local accents but also the bleak weather and gnarly terrain. The week was spent hiking the Irish loop, fishing for brown trout and eating a lot of cod.
