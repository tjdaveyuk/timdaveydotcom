  We left chaotic Toronto in search of something more peaceful. My great uncle Ken bought a 200 acre plot of land in 1974 and over the space of many years, built a log cabin, a sugar shack to make maple syrup and a huge barn for his many vehicles. I had the chance to visit when I was 15 and couldn't wait to go back. The cabin is located a few hours north of Barrie, Ontario close to the town of Parry Sound. This region is known to most in Ontario as 'Cottage Country'.
